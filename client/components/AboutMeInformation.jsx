        Coding has been a passion of mine for years, dating back to my teen years. I attented college for 2 years before hardship happened and had to work full time and put school on the backburner. CV-19 came and i decided it was time for a change.

        This incorporates into my coding background as well, i have always played games dating back to the gamecube, and started getting curious as to how the infrastructure was setup during PS3 era. Got my hands wet with Unity, coding, and some terminal commands but ultimately during age 16 i started my first job.

      <div className="AboutMeInformationParagraph">
        Although coding is my passion, when i am not building i'm out spending time with my 2 year old daughter !
        Being able to seperate work time from family time is a big deal for me so i tend to block out any coding when spending time with family unless being directly asked about it.

      <div className="AboutMeInformationParagraph">
        When not spending time with my family, i enjoy learning new tech. There is always room for growth and with all the tech out there, picking something to learn shouldn't be too hard. I focus on things i enjoy too or need to learn to keep me from getting distracted.
