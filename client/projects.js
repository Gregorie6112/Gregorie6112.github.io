I recognized my weak spots and decided to improve on it by building an application that would visualize the algorithms working. Utilized Figma for component building, Continuous Integration, Jest unit testing, and currently working on refactoring to use React Hooks."

If a new request was submitted for the same ticker, it would update the database with the new most up to date price."
